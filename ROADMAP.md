# Product Roadmap

## Future Features

### 1. Storm Motion Vectors
**Status:** Planned / Backlog

Calculate and display the forward speed (knots) and heading (compass direction) for each point along the storm track.

**Requirements:**
*   **Logic:** Use Haversine formula to calculate distance between consecutive points.
*   **Time:** Calculate time delta between points.
*   **Derived Data:** Speed = Distance / Time.
*   **UI:** Display in the Data Log (e.g., "12kts @ NW").

### 2. Advanced Map Layers
*   Satellite Imagery Overlay
*   Sea Surface Temperature (SST) History
*   Cone of Uncertainty (Historical)

### 3. Analytics
*   ACE (Accumulated Cyclone Energy) Calculator
*   Season Comparison Tool
